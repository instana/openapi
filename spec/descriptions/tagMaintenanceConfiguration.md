### Maintenance Windows
Maintenance windows allow you to mute alerts.

### Types of Maintenance Configurations
**One-Time**: Executed once at a fixed scheduled time, after which the configuration expires.

**Recurrent**: Executed on a schedule basis (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly).

### Pausing or Resuming Maintenance Configurations
Maintenance windows can be paused or resumed.

If a maintenance configuration is paused, alerts for the events matching the scope of the configuration will no longer be muted.
