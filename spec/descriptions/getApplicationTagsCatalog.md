Use this API endpoint to retrieve a list of tags.
This API endpoint also shows tags which are grouped together. This grouping also denotes the dimensionality of an event. Eg: `Call` can have 9 attributes.
Also these tags have cardinality ranging from low to high which will help in examining broad or narrow patterns during the analysis.
Queryable tags is a powerful enabler for slice and dice analysis in `Query Builder` which is present in `Unbounded Analytics`.
