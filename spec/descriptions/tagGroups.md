Groups are used to permit individual users to perform specific actions and get visibility to an access scope. Each user can be assigned to multiple groups, every one coming with its associated permissions. In addition a group sets the access scope and you can configure the visible areas for the group members.

When you are a member of multiple groups, your permissions have an additive effect.

Granting access to certain entities within Instana (e.g. Applications, Kubernetes Clusters etc.) is done through a corresponding entry in the `permissionSet` payload.
