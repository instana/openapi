If mappings between groups on the identity provider (LDAP, OIDC, SAML) and Instana groups where configured, this will return a list of those mappings.

This can be configured through the [api](#operation/createGroupMapping) or on Instana graphical user interface at Settings > Authentication > IDENTITY PROVIDERS > Group Mapping.
