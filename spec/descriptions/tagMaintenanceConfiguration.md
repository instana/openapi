### Maintenance Windows
Maintenance windows allow you to mute alerts.

### Pausing Maintenance Windows
Maintenance windows can be paused and resumed.

If a maintenance window is paused, alerts will no longer be muted. 

_NOTE: Pausing unmutes alerts. Maintenance Status is separate from pausing a maintenance window._

### Maintenance Status
These are the possible states the Maintenance Configuration can be in:
- ACTIVE
- FINISHED
- SCHEDULED

_NOTE: Maintenance Status is based on how the recurrence is configured. Maintenance Status is separate from pausing a maintenance window._
